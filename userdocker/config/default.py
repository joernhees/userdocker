# WARNING:
# /etc/userdocker/default.py will not be loaded at runtime, but is meant as a
# template! It will be overwritten by future installs/updates!
# Copy this file to /etc/docker/config.py, then edit!
#
# The following (python) variables may be used throughout config files (see
# VOLUME_MOUNTS_DEFAULT or ENV_VARS for an example):
from . import uid, gid, user_name, group_name, user_home
# (if you like, you can remove the line without any effect)
#
# The order of config files is (if existing):
# - package defaults
# - /etc/userdocker/config.py
# - /etc/userdocker/group/config_<prio>_<group_name>.py (see note below)
# - /etc/userdocker/gid/config_<prio>_<gid>.py (see note below)
# - /etc/userdocker/user/config_<user_name>.py
# - /etc/userdocker/uid/config_<uid>.py
#
# All config files are executed in place, allowing later config files to
# override or modify previous ones. The above might sound complicated, but just
# start with a /etc/userdocker/config.py and then define exceptions later.
#
# As a user can be in several groups, the group configs include a 2 digit prio.
# On execution, we will get all groups for the user, collect the corresponding
# config files matching those groups if they exist and load all collected
# config files sorted ascending by prio. Lowest prio is 00 (loaded first),
# highest prio is 99 (loaded last).
# Afterwards the same is done for gid config files.
#
# Example: if a user is in groups "adm" and "udocker" and an admin created the
# config files config_99_adm.py and config_50_udocker.py, then the execution
# order is:
# - package defaults
# - /etc/userdocker/config.py
# - /etc/userdocker/group/config_50_udocker.py
# - /etc/userdocker/group/config_99_adm.py
# - ...
# This means that config_99_adm.py can grant users in group adm a lot more
# permissions (reliably), even if they are also in the udocker group.

# nvidia docker specific settings

# - NV_ALLOWED_GPUS allows you to only make a subset of GPUs available to users.
#   Setting this to [] or None will result in nvidia-docker to always fail as no
#   GPUs are available. If that's desired, you should instead remove the
#   nvidia-docker executor above, as that's less confusing for users!
# - NV_DEFAULT_GPU_COUNT_RESERVATION allows to specify how many GPUs are passed
#   to a container if the user does not specify the NV_GPU env var. This is
#   different from the nvidia-docker defaults, which would by default allow
#   access to all GPUs!
# - NV_MAX_GPU_COUNT_RESERVATION allows you to limit the amount of GPUs made
#   available to a single container. Setting this to -1 means no limit.
# - GPUs on which more than NV_GPU_UNAVAILABLE_ABOVE_MEMORY_USED MB of memory is
#   used will be marked as unavailable. This setting is userdocker independent.
#   Setting this to -1 results in GPUs always being regarded as available.
# - If NV_EXCLUSIVE_GPU_RESERVATION is set, any GPUs already used in any other
#   container are regarded as unavailable for this container.
# - NV_ALLOW_OWN_GPU_REUSE allows users to run multiple containers on GPUs they
#   already use. This only happens when explicitly setting NV_GPU.
